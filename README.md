Hello! I completed this project with the goal of showcasing my data analysis skills in Python. 
As I have developed my skills, I realize that Excel, Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, all have very similar ways of operating. 
Like the romance languages, once you have a good handle on one, the rest come easily. 
Please feel free to look through the following code and documentation. I hope it can supply an idea of my thought processes and skill level. 
As mentioned, these skills are constantly being developed and refined, so please do not take one project as the entire scope of my capabilities. 

Thanks for looking!
